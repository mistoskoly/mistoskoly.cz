# K čemu je škola

(llewellyn)

1. Get kids out of the adults' hair:
   - house
   - street
   - labour market
2. Grade, rank, label => Go to society slot and accept it without protest.
3. Teach about reality. Prepare for real life = boring alienated work, empty of skill or serious purpose & equally alienated and passive leisure. Life of mass production and consumption, factory, tv.
